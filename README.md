# Hydrologic Cycle Simulator

- Click on the action buttons to make the water cycle from one place to another one.
- Maybe you'll be able to create a storm?

This is a project originally made by me (Goncalerta) in [KhanAcademy](http://khanacademy.org/) back in 2015.
Almost no changes where made, only those really needed to make it able to run outside the website.
